# Java 9 Top Features
This repository contains a collection of code examples for the top features of Java 9, the latest release of the popular programming language.

## Features
Java 9 introduces several new features and enhancements that make it easier to write efficient, maintainable, and scalable code. The code examples in this repository cover the following features:

### Modularization: 
Java 9 introduced the Java Platform Module System (JPMS), which provides a modular architecture for Java applications. With JPMS, developers can create modular applications that can be easily managed and updated.

### JShell: 
JShell is a new interactive shell that allows developers to experiment with code snippets and test ideas without having to write full-fledged programs. The code examples demonstrate how to use JShell to explore Java 9 features.

### Performance improvements: 
Java 9 includes several performance improvements, including better memory management and faster startup times.

### Stream API Enhancements: 
Java 9 includes several enhancements to the Stream API, such as new methods for creating streams, filtering, and collecting elements. The code examples demonstrate how to use these new features to write cleaner, more concise code.

### Multi-release JARs: 
Java 9 introduced the ability to create JAR files that contain different versions of the same class for different Java releases. This feature makes it easier for developers to write code that works across multiple Java versions.

### Reactive Streams: 
Reactive Streams is a new API that makes it easier to write asynchronous, non-blocking code. The code examples demonstrate how to use Reactive Streams to build more responsive applications.

### HTTP/2 Client: 
Java 9 introduces a new HTTP/2 client API that provides better performance and functionality compared to the old HttpURLConnection API. The code examples demonstrate how to use the new HTTP/2 client to make requests to remote servers.

### Unicode enhancements: 
Java 9 includes enhancements to the Unicode support, including new methods for working with Unicode code points.

### Process API Enhancements: 
Java 9 introduces several enhancements to the Process API, including the ability to get the process ID and information about the process environment. The code examples demonstrate how to use these new features to manage and monitor processes.
